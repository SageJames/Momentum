# Momentum

## Introduction

As a developer, I am used to being inside for long periods of time. But that's not the case for most people. Before covid-19 many people have lives and were able to enjoy themselves. But with quarantine they have had to cut their experiences short and settle with staying at home. I thought about this for a long time and decided to make an application to help people that may be facing stress while in quarantine. The momentum application was made for this sole purpose. Is an application that aims to provide users with a set of tools that will allow them to relax or improve themselves. They can take the array of items that I've offered in this application and use them to not only improve themselves but the people around them as well.


## Motivation

I want to implement some of the things I was learning for my philosophy class into a application. By taking family walks and Performing exercises they are within the application, users can improve the lives of not only themselves, but the people around them as well.




## How to use this application

### :house: Home
The home view allows you to see an array of different tools and method to relax. Scroll throght them and when you see one you want to try click it for a pop up link.

### :relaxed: Meditation
**Be very  careful with this tab.** Once you click on the meditation tab, you have just made a promise you yourself. You will now take 16:40 to sit, walk, or dosomething that improves you. Like time once this timer has been click there is nothing you can do to stop in. Will you hold up that promise you made yourself or will you let it fall to time?
### :book: Log
This a strange log. You can only write in it but never access it. This is a place to make place thing you care about but want to let go. Like us these messages have a time stamp, once you click it, it is gone forever.
