# Momentum

## About

This is a open source medatation application for people that are stress out from Covid-19 quarantine. This allows a user to access an array of information relaxation to meditation and relation without having to preform research, 

## Motivation

I want to implement some of the things I was learning for my philosophy class into a application.


## How to use this application

### Home :house:
The home view allows you to see an array of different tools and method to relax. Scroll throght them and when you see one you want to try click it for a pop up link.

### Meditation :relaxed:
**Be very  careful with this tab.** Once you click on the meditation tab, you have just made a promise you yourself. You will now take 16:40 to sit, walk, or dosomething that improves you. Like time once this timer has been click there is nothing you can do to stop in. Will you hold up that promise you made yourself or will you let it fall to time?
### Log :book:
This a strange log. You can only write in it but never access it. This is a place to make place thing you care about but want to let go. Like us these messages have a time stamp, once you click it, it is gone forever.
